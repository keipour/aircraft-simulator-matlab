- Allow contact at any point of the multirotor
- Add moment estimation from contact point
- Add force controller
- Add moment controller
- Add mixer-based control allocation
- Add pre-written controller files (similar to the robots)
- Improve the contact detection in simulation
- Add attitude strategies
- Add Euler-Lagrange dynamics
- Add different control methods
- Rewrite the intersect method for collision detection
- Add the execution time animation support
- Implement different controllers
- Add wind gusts
